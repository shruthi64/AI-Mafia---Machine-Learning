Chemical Segregation

Can you Separate the chemicals? - Binary Classification Challenge

A chemist has two chemical flasks labelled 1 and 0 which contains two different chemicals.
He extracted 3 features from these chemicals in order to distinguish between them. You are
provided with the results derived by the chemist and your task is to create a model that will
label chemical 0 or 1 given its three features.

Data Description :

You are provided with two files test and train.

● Train: This files consists of two csv files Logistic Xtrain and LogisticYtrain. Xtrain
consists of the features whereas Ytrain consists of the labels associated with the
features.

● Test: This file consists of two files Logistic Xtest consisting of the features of test
data
